Folder Structure
bash

/app

Notes
The project uses the Canvas API to draw the image and overlays captions and date.

The caption sanitization removes special characters to create safe filenames.

The sonner toast system provides instant feedback on errors or success.

The date picker uses shadcn/uiâ€™s Calendar with a popover trigger.

This app requires no backend or external API; everything runs client-side.
